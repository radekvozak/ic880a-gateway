# The Things Network: iC880a-based gateway

Reference setup for [The Things Network](http://thethingsnetwork.org/) gateways based on the iC880a SPI concentrator with a Raspberry Pi host.

This installer targets the **SPI version** of the board, if you have the USB version, [check this branch](https://github.com/ttn-zh/ic880a-gateway/tree/master).

## Setup

Check [a step-by-step HOWTO in our wiki](https://github.com/ttn-zh/ic880a-gateway/wiki) for a detailed explanation of the hardware that needs to be purchased and the software setup you will have to configure. 

## Installation

- Clone the installer and start the installation

        $ git clone https://github.com/radekvozak/ic880a-gateway.git ~/ic880a-gateway
        $ cd ~/ic880a-gateway
        $ sudo ./install.sh spi

## Update

        $ sudo ./install.sh spi
